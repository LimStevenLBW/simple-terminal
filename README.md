# Termina, A trivial Unix/Linux terminal

## Installation
This program was tested using various versions Ubuntu, including the latest version of the time of writing, 18.04.3
Running any other OS may have unexpected results, but it is expected to run correctly on any Unix/Linux system.

Simply, clone the repo and run the command make in the directory. Then simply run the executable.
- if command make is not found, install it with 
```sudo apt install make```

If your OS states that executable permission is denied, right click its properties and allow the file as executable.
